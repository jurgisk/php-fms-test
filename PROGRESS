- Added a bit of a folder structure
- Added namespaces to make the loading easier. For this project I'm not going to assume there's an autoloader
- Added the implementation of JK in a separate directory to make it more like "pluggable in"
- Noticed that the setCreatedTime does not require the parameter to be an object.
- Auto loader was chosen as a quick way to get things moving, however I'm aware that a lot of people use auto generated clasmaps to achieve the same thing.
- Note. Because Folder stores full path, if some folder "in the middle" gets renamed, all the relevant entries will have to be updated as well
- On the other hand - this way we dont have to do recursive lookup to build the full path, which is good for speed.
- Folders have a name and a path, where files have only name. Personally I think files should also have names
- TODO - make sure text limits in mysql are not exceeded, by adding length checks and exeptions thrown..
- Started writing an interface for universally usable DB adapter, but abandoned the ide because it would take too long. Will commit this in code, just to show what the thinking was at the time (under library/JDI/Persistent)
- createFile method name probably is not the best pick - I would say - insertFile or newFile would be a bit more intuitive
- TODO Folder test - add getter and setter test for id
- The parent folder is a bit strange that it's in 2 places - in file interface and in filesystem interface, so people might get confused.
Probably a better implementation fro filesystem would be createFile($file) without the parent folder, because you can set that to go within file object
- Possibly 2 methods for root folders and child folders is a bit excessive - could be as simple as - if parent is null, then it's a root folder
- To make check simpler, I'm going to persist full file path in database for files
- TODO - ADD TEST CASE FOR FILE ID
- Rename file is kind of update file, except theres the additional hassle of renaming the physical file - which I'm skipping..
- TODO - need to think about how to make these actions more transitional, so that a full check is done upfront without persisting anything in db
- TODO - it would be nice to have try / catch statements around all the database operations
- I dont think the command line interface was a great idea :D
